<h2>Reddit Sentiment Analysis Pipeline</h2>
This project is still very much a work in progress, as is the paper. The core functionality is in place, accomplishing the goal I had set out for in my data engineering course at Radford, but several features are still in the testing/debugging phase. This includes the filtering of search results from multiple subreddits and keywords in the same section, the Postgres database connection for storing execution results, and the use of transformers in place of VADER analysis (this is a setting that can be configured by altering the appropriate values in <code>config/pipeline_config.json</code>)

---
### UPDATE (1/8/2024):
I've nearly completed the project. But - I re-wrote/generated most of the code (to be less functional / more class-based, among other things)... So I will be replacing this code with the new once it's finished (the new is much better! ðŸ˜‰ )

## Overview

This project is a modular, scalable pipeline designed to analyze sentiment in Reddit threads and comments. The pipeline integrates data collection, transformation, sentiment analysis, storage, and visualization.

**Key features:**

- Real-time or batch data collection from Reddit using PRAW.
- Configurable cleaning and normalization of Reddit posts and comments.
- Sentiment analysis using VADER or Transformer-based models.
- Data storage in PostgreSQL and JSON files.
- Visualization of sentiment trends over time.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.8 or higher.
2. PostgreSQL installed and running (optional for database storage).
3. Necessary libraries installed (see `requirements.txt`).

---

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/reddit-sentiment-pipeline.git
    ```
    ```bash
    cd reddit-sentiment-pipeline
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
